### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Dennis Kyalo, a current graduate student pursuing a Masterâ€™s of Science degree in Data Science at the State University of New York at Buffalo. Additionally, I hold an undergraduate degree in Bachelor of Science in Financial Engineering, from which I acquired immense knowledge and skills in Mathematics, Statistics, Finance, and R-programming. 

My area of focus is maximizing value by applying data science to business. I have experience in data modeling, visualization, machine learning, and reporting.

I enjoy learning and using data to make informed decisions.
