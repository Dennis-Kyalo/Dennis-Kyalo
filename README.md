### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Dennis Kyalo, a current graduate student pursuing a Masterâ€™s of Science degree in Data Science at the State University of New York at Buffalo. Additionally, I hold an undergraduate degree in Bachelor of Science in Financial Engineering, from which I acquired immense knowledge and skills in Mathematics, Statistics, Finance, and R-programming. 

I enjoy applying my data modeling, visualization, machine learning, and reporting skills in the business sector so as to create value for companies by understanding and analyzing their financial cost of problems and delivering a return-on-investment with my solutions. I enjoy learning and using data to make informed decisions.
