### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Dennis Kyalo, a Data Science graduate from the State University of New York at Buffalo. I also hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Financial Engineering, through which I developed extensive expertise in Mathematics, Statistics, Finance, and R-programming.

My primary focus lies in leveraging data science to drive business value. I possess robust experience in data modeling, visualization, machine learning, and reporting.

I thrive on continued learning and utilize data-driven insights to inform and enhance decision-making processes.
